## GETTING STARTED WITH SENSOR DATA MARCH-JUNE 2017
## ABOUT THE SERIES

This series is about working with sensor data for autonomous vehicles and is based on Civil Maps’ real world experiences with these technologies. We started working with LiDAR data in 2013. We were providing 3D mapping for heavy industries such as railroads and pipeline projects. For the purpose of these sessions, we are focused on LiDAR, IMU, and sensor fusion, although other sensors may be discussed in future webinars.

*Session One:*  Here we cover some basics of how LiDAR works with an emphasis on how Civil Maps uses LiDAR. Via a code walkthrough, we show you how to read a sample LiDAR dataset and how to visualize it in a visualizer. We are open-sourcing our hardware abstraction layer (HAL). The discussion includes transforming spherical coordinates into the cartesian system. We talk about packet structure and provide a quick look at our Atlas DevKit and Atlas DevKit Lite, which are low-cost hardware/software development kits for localization, 3D mapping, and data collection.

*Session Two (Thursday, April 27th 1:30 PM PST (4:30 PM EST):* We discuss how GPS and IMU work together in the context of capturing vehicle motion and a simple technique for creating a trajectory from a sample set of IMU data. After part 1 & 2 you will be able to generate a point cloud by fusing the IMU trajectory and the LiDAR data.

*Session Three (Thursday, April 27th 1:30 PM PST (4:30 PM EST):* The conversation covers transforming LiDAR data from different vehicle mounting positions. We also talk about the time synchronization between LiDAR and IMU.

*Session Four (Thursday, June 29th 1:30 PST (4:30 PM EST):* For the last segment, we create and register a point cloud by fusing LiDAR and IMU sensor data

## INSTRUCTORS

**Scott Harvey** is a Co-founder and Computer Vision Engineer at Civil Maps. He leads engineering efforts for the Localization team, which has developed innovative compression technology and has pioneered localization in 6 dimensions. Scott has a technical expertise in Computer Vision and Control Systems. He earned engineering degrees from Brown University and Stanford University. When he’s not working on localizing self-driving cars in six degrees of freedom, Scott plays in a band called “Tourist Club.”           

**David Bulnes** is a Technical Consultant for Atlas DevKit at Civil Maps. He works on the company’s data pipeline, which includes fusing sensor information from R&D and its automotive customers. His experience spans an array of technologies in software, mechanical engineering, and robotics. In previous roles, David served on robotics teams at Tesla and Visa. His early software development experience includes positions at Cisco, Caravan Interactive, and PS|Ship. David studied at the University of Santa Cruz, earning a degree in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Robotics  and Control Systems.  A motorcycle enthusiast, he spends weekend time riding and working on his bike. He also is a Ducati valves specialist.
